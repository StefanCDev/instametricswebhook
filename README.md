# Go Serverless Webhook Handler

This is a simple Go serverless webhook handler that accepts POST requests with JSON payloads. The handler decodes the received JSON and prints it to the server logs. If the request is not a POST request, the server will respond with a "405 Method Not Allowed" error.

## Features

- Handles POST requests at the `/webhook` endpoint.
- Decodes incoming JSON data and logs it to the server.
- Responds with a `200 OK` status for successful POST requests.
- Responds with a `405 Method Not Allowed` status for non-POST requests.
- Returns a `400 Bad Request` status if there is an error in decoding the JSON data.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher
